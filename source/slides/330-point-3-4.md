# Call them to action

```js
...

  //setBasicContext(content.who, content.when, content.where);
  //setUpObstacle(content.point_A);   
  //setUpBenefit(content.point_B);
  //setUpSolution(content.illustration);
  
  //describeSolution(content.steps);
  
  //restateObstacle(content.point_A);
  //reviewIllustration(content.illustration);
  //restateBenefit(content.point_B);
  callToAction(content.cta);
   
...
```

Note:

But wait, you're not quite done. What should they do now? What is the next step?

Make this clear with a call to action?

Even though you may not be persuading them to do something, you still need to help them understand how they can act on the information.
