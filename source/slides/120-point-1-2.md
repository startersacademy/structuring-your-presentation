```js
...

  function setUpObstacle( point_A ){ ... }
  
  function greatPresentation( content ){
  
    //setBasicContext(content.who, content.when, content.where);
    setUpObstacle(content.point_A);
     
  }

...
```

Note:

After you help the audience understand the basic context, you introduce the obstacle.

This is point A. 

The problem that needs to be solved

The irritation that needs to be addressed

The chance that needs to be taken

The knowledge that needed to be gained
