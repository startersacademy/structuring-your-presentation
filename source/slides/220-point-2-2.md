Note: 

That doesn't mean, however, that you still can't make the presentation interesting. This slide summarizes some of the advice from a great book called Made to Stick. It talks about ways to make information more memorable.

By sticking to the shortest path to build up the illustration, you have Simple and Story covered.

By grounding the presentation in something personal, you can cover Credible and Emotional.

Use unexpected examples, real code, or errors to add the the Unexpected and Concrete elements.
