```js
...

  function setUpSolution( illustration ){ ... }
  
  function greatPresentation( content ){

    //setBasicContext(content.who, content.when, content.where);
    //setUpObstacle(content.point_A);
    //setUpBenefit(content.point_B);
    setUpSolution(content.illustration);
     
  }

...
```

Note: 

By now the audience should want to know how to get from point A to point B.

So set up the solution. 

What is the one thing they should know about how to get from point A to point B?

How can you illustrate/visualize that solution? 

The illustration is the "last thing", the point you will be building to.
