```js
...

  function setUpBenefit( point_B ){ ... }
  
  function greatPresentation( content ){
  
    //setBasicContext(content.who, content.when, content.where);
    //setUpObstacle(content.point_A);
    setUpBenefit(content.point_B);
     
  }

...
```

Note:

The next function sets up point B. The destination, the goal, the happy place, the audience wants to reach.

This is the benefit the audience will get by following your advice.

With these three little functions, you set up dramatic tension--the same sort of tension that drives the best novels and movies.
