```js
...

  function setBasicContext( who, when, where ){ ... }
  
  function greatPresentation( content ){
  
    setBasicContext(content.who, content.when, content.where);
     
  }

...
```

Note:

You can think of the structure of your presentation as a function. 

You input content, run it through a series of sub-functions, and at the end you can get a well-structured presentation.

The first function sets the basic context.

Who is this presentation relevant to?

When (in what circumstances) would you use the information?

Where (in what environments) is this relevant?
